This program prints rainbow output to the console using a custom color library written in rust. 

## Quickstart

In order to run this program, [install cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and:

```
cargo run
```
This will downlaod the dependency -- [terminal_size](https://crates.io/crates/terminal_size) -- and build the program. After it's finished, it will run.
